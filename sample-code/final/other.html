		    <li>In the 1960s, following the establishment of DC Comics' multiverse system,[75] the Golden Age version of Aquaman became known as the Aquaman of Earth-Two, while the Silver Age version of Aquaman became the Aquaman of Earth-One. Although the two versions never met, the Earth-Two Aquaman did appear post-Golden Age in All-Star Squadron #59–60 (July – August 1986), just before the character was retroactively eliminated from existence via the 1985 "Crisis on Infinite Earths" storyline.[76]</li>
<li>The 1980s series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew presented the parallel Earth of "Earth-C-Minus," a world populated by funny animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus featured Aquaduck, a duck version of Aquaman with similar powers.[77]</li>
<li>Aquaman watches over the seas and his kingdom in the Supergirl: Wings Elseworlds story.</li>
<li>Arthur Curry appears in the 1997 Tangent Comics one-shot Green Lantern, in which he is revealed to be the son of pilot Captain Boomerang, and a member of Boomerang's fleet.</li>
<li>In the Antimatter Universe inhabited by the Crime Syndicate of Amerika, Barracuda is Aquaman's CSA counterpart. He was last seen leading the armies of Atlantis against the surface world in Florida.[volume & issue needed]</li>
<li>In the Countdown tie-in The Search for Ray Palmer: Superwoman/Batwoman, a female version of Aquaman is shown to reside on Earth-11. This version is called "Anne", is physically similar to Joseph Curry, and commands the armies of Atlantis. The Aquawoman of the slightly revised Earth-11 appears in The Multiversity #1 (2014) as one of the assembled heroes of the Multiverse who have come together to save it from destruction.</li>
<li>In the 2003–04 intercompany crossover JLA/Avengers, Aquaman teams up with the Avenger Vision to investigate the changes to their respective Earth's as a result of the actions of the Grandmaster. He displays his immense psychic control over sea life when he single-handedly shuts down the minds of Atlantean soldiers under the control of Attuma, although his abilities only partially affect Namor due to Namor's half-human physiology.</li>
<li>In the alternate timeline of the 2011 "Flashpoint" storyline, Aquaman is brought back to Atlantis when he was a teenager, due to the death of his father. As a result, the young Arthur never learned compassion and kindness from his father, who was killed by the Atlantean agents sent to recover him.[78] In the present day, Aquaman and all of Atlantis wage war against Wonder Woman and the Amazons,[79] which began when Diana's mother, Hippolyta, was killed on Aquaman and Diana's wedding day, and in an act of retribution, Wonder Woman later killed Mera who had apparently married Aquaman.[80] The death of Hippolyta was however revealed to be a casualty of war as the real target was Wonder Woman. Aquaman causes Western Europe to sink into the, sea killing over 60 million people, and intends to sink England as well.[81] In the present, Aquaman reassigns Siren and Ocean Master to assassinate Terra in New Themyscira. The mission failed, with Siren being killed by Diana's aunt, Penthesleia. The Amazonian Furies then attack the reinforcements led by Aquaman, who is confronted in battle by their leader, Wonder Woman.[78] During their struggle, Wonder Woman tells him that they have both been deceive by Ocean Master and Penthesileia, who are responsible for the war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons.[82] This Aquaman returns in Convergence: Justice League #1.</li>
<li>During the 2013 "Trinity War" storyline, Aquaman's Crime Syndicate counterpart is revealed to be Sea King. He apparently fails to survive the passage from Earth-3 to Prime Earth. The design of Sea King resembles that of 1990s Aquaman.[83] but is awakened in "Forever Evil: Blight"[84] after being possessed by Deadman.[85]</li>
<li>In the prequel comic to the game "Injustice: Gods Among Us" Aquaman appears to attack Japanese fisherman who kill a whale. He is intercepted by the Justice League, with it turning into a brawl between the League and the Atlanteans. Superman, having undergone the death of his wife and unborn child and the destruction of Metropolis, threatens Aquaman to stop his efforts. While warned over a communication link with Batman not to test him, Aquaman does by summoning a kraken. In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants in harm to bully Aquaman. He relents and as a result of this largely abstains from the conflict between the Regime (led by Superman) and the Insurgency (led by Batman). In Year Four he gets involved, however, when Batman informs him that the Greek gods have attempted to force their own rule over the world, so Aquaman and Mera take on Poseidon. He wins the conflict as his wife stalls a massive tidal wave from crashing on Themiscyra.</li>
